# Project03 - Viva Mexico!

## Building the Pyramid
- Using several probuilder cubes, they were arranged to have the different layers of the pyramid. 
- Faces of the cubes were subdivided to rearrange the angles.
- Cut option was used to remove the unnecessary parts.
- Extrude tool was used to freely elevate the figure.
- Once the base layer was finished, it was duplicated and the dimensions were changed to smaller dimensions.
- Different png files were looked for to serve as base for the different textures of the pyramid.
- After the pyramid was done, probuilder cubes were used once more to make the little houses at the top of the pyramid.
- Using the same methods listed above, we made a first house and then duplicated it to get a second one. 
## Assets Used for the Project

 ## Building the Scene
- A small composition was made and duplicated across the scene in different positions and rotations.
- The color of the terrain was changed using the materials from [Low-Poly Simple Nature Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/low-poly-simple-nature-pack-162153).
- Water resemblence was added using [Simple Water Shader](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/water/simple-water-shader-urp-191449).
- Characters were added using [Low Poly Human](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/free-low-poly-human-rpg-character-219979) as well as animals with the [Animated Goat and Sheep](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/animated-goat-and-sheep-3d-low-poly-free-251910).
- After everything was added, we duplicated already planted assets to make the scene look livelier.
