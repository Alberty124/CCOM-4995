# Kirby Tales

**Kirby Ninja** 
A ferociously hungry warrior of the shadows and will protect the food 
from anybody who tries to steal it. With his set of ninja stars and his katana 
nobody can rival his mastery of ninjitsu. By the time you hear a very soft “poyo” it 
would be too late, and you will find yourself in a prison cell in the morning. 
This doesn’t mean Kirby ninja is merciless, he counts with the love and trust of the shogunate, 
the Chef Kawasaki, General Meta Knight, and everyone in Dream Land.

**Kirby Missile** 
Manufactured by an eccentric engineer who was once saved by the amazing and ever-hungry Kirby. 
The engineer made the rocket look like Kirby but also made it powerful like him, capable of breaking 
through any obstacle. Of course, Kirby himself doesn’t know this as he mostly travels with his bird 
friend Dyna Blade, the speedy warp star, and more. The engineer keeps working on the Kirby missile to 
improve it and give it to Kirby, to show gratitude. Although he would be the happiest pink ball if he 
received some freshly made dish.

**Kirby Suplex** 
A very strong and almost on par with Kirby Fighter. This little fighter joined the Food Wars, a tournament 
only for the strongest, to win the first prize that consists of a lifetime supply of yogurt and apples and 
a celebration banquet. A warrior such as Kirby Suplex couldn’t resist the chance to eat, I mean, fight for 
the honor. He took on Mr. Frosty and Waddle Do DX and won, but now he must face off against the one and only 
King Dedede for the title of champion. They both want to eat delicious food, so as it's known, “Hunger makes right!!!”.

After the excruciating war against the intergalactic alien corporation HWC, Popstar was finally freed from their clutches. 
Even so, now Kirby must make haste to put an end once and for all to their evil plans. With the remnants of alien technology, 
the smartest minds of Popstar put together a special armor suit and thus **Kirby Mecha** came to be. With a pair of gauntlets 
of astronomical strength, blaster gun attachments powered by the Warp Star, a visor with an auto-lock system, and a drink compartment 
in the helmet for Kirby’s apple juice. With all this, our small valiant hero is ready to take to the stars once again. The road may be 
long but the vast universe is open to new culinary horizons to taste and share with his friends back home.
