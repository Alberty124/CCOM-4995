1. The first step on making the Kirby was creating a prefab Kirby model. It was made using
a set of capsules and spheres modified in various ways to shape the iconic Kirby character.

2. When we had Kirby prefab done, the next thing on the agenda was selecting Kirby's to recreate.
From the huge selection they were picked 4: Ninja Kirby, Suplex Kirby, Missile Kirby, and
Mecha Kirby.

3. It was started with Ninja Kirby, his modeling required a bit of creativity to imitate the shape
of the ninja mask kirby wears. It was possible with multiple modified cubes and spheres. To make the
sharper parts like the kunai knife and star symbol, capsules and cubes were added.

4. For Suplex Kirby it was needed to make his headband as dynamic as possible, so through a string of
segmented cubes the headband was made alongside the power pose during his attack.

5. The Missile Kirby was fairly simple. But due to that, the design needed to have more "style" to it.
So smoke objects were made and orange particles added.

6. Kirby mecha was the one where most time was invested, also my favorite one. Since the mechanical aspect
of the character is closer to 8-bit, it felt like making a pixel art. A great variety of heriarchy groups
had to be created to maintain the sense of order, because parts like the helmet and gauntlets had a lot
of details in them.

7. It must be noted that the original Kirby prefab was merged with the other Kirby's after all 4 were
duplicated. Even more, the prefabs were made independent and no longer variants.
