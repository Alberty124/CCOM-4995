# Project00 - Building a House

## Building a Floor
We started by building a floor using the `plane` object and placing it on the ground.

## Building the Walls
- For the walls, we used the `cube` object and adjusted it to represent walls.
- Placed the walls on the sides of the house.
- Copied and pasted the wall for the backside and opposite side of the house.
- Worked on shorter front walls to represent a door leading inside of the house.

## Building the Roof
- For the roof, we used a slightly thinner `cube` object on top of the "door" to represent the door more clearly.
- Repurposed the same `cube` objects used for the side and backside walls.

## Cylinders
- Added `cylinders` to the front side of the house to add more detail.

## Experience Gained
One of the things that was fun about this project was the slow and meticulous process of
building the house. We really enjoyed it because every time we would finish adding one of 
the objects to the house, we were able to appreciate it how closer we were to making an
actual house. It was also really fun to revise the house and put a hierarchy on our objects to 
classify them better and make them more legible for us. The addition of the cylinders was 
also very exciting as we didn't need to add them but we decided to put them there anyway so 
that the house could look a little different and had more to it than just walls and a roof. While 
it doesn't necessarily make it that much different, it still adds enough to make it a little 
unique than a regular house that might've been built.
